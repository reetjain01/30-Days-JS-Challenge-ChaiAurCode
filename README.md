## Day 10: Event Handling 
Master various event handling techniques in JavaScript, including basic events, mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and event delegation. Learn to manipulate the DOM through event listeners and handlers to create interactive web pages.

## Day 11: Promise and Async/Await
Learn the fundamentals of asynchronous JavaScript with Promises and Async/Await. Understand how to create and handle promises, chain them, and manage errors. Explore the use of async functions and the power of fetching data from APIs. Gain proficiency in handling concurrent promises using Promise.all and Promise.race.

## Day 12: Error Handling
Master error handling in JavaScript by using try-catch blocks, creating custom error objects, and working with the finally block. Learn to handle errors in promises and async/await functions gracefully. Practice fetching data from APIs and managing errors effectively to ensure robust and reliable code.

## Day 13: Modules
Explore the power of JavaScript modules by creating and exporting your own, using named and default exports, and importing entire modules. Learn to leverage third-party modules like Lodash and Axios to simplify tasks such as array operations and HTTP requests. Practice module bundling with tools like Webpack to optimize your codebase for production.

## Day 14: Classes
Learn the power of object-oriented programming in JavaScript with classes. Understand how to define classes, create instances, and use methods and properties. Explore inheritance to extend classes and create hierarchical structures. Master static methods and properties for utility functions, and use getters and setters for encapsulation. Finally, discover private fields to safeguard class internals, ensuring robust and maintainable code.

## Day 15: Closures
Dive into closures in JavaScript and explore how they can be used to create private variables, maintain state, and generate unique identifiers. Understand practical applications such as creating counters, unique IDs, and managing tasks using the module pattern. Learn how closures can impact loops and be utilized for memoization to optimize performance by caching results of expensive function calls. This day will help you master the power of closures for effective and efficient coding.

## Day 16: Recursion
Master recursion in JavaScript with tasks like calculating factorials, generating Fibonacci sequences, and manipulating arrays and strings. Learn recursive solutions for finding maximum elements, reversing strings, and searching arrays. Understand recursion's power and pitfalls through practical exercises.

## Day 17: Data Structures
Explore key data structures: manage nodes with Linked Lists, implement LIFO operations with Stacks, handle FIFO with Queues, and organize hierarchical data using Binary Trees. Practice adding, removing, and traversing elements to strengthen your data management skills.

## Day 18: Algorithms
Master key algorithms by diving into sorting with Bubble, Selection, and Quick Sort. Enhance your search skills with Linear and Binary Search. Explore string algorithms to count characters occurrences and find the longest substring without repeating characters. Optimize array manipulations with rotation and merging techniques to handle and process data effectively.  

## Day 19: Regular Expressions
Explore the power of Regular Expressions with a range of tasks. Learn basic patterns for matching specific text, digits, and character classes. Utilize quantifiers to handle varying amounts of text. Dive into grouping and capturing to extract parts of strings, such as phone numbers and email addresses. Understand assertions and boundaries for precise matches. Finally, apply these concepts to validate passwords and URLs, enhancing your ability to manage and validate data effectively.

## Day 20: LocalStorage and SessionStorage
Delve into web storage with LocalStorage and SessionStorage. Learn to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in both storages through various tasks. Understand how to handle JSON objects and update content dynamically. Compare LocalStorage and SessionStorage by saving and clearing data, and explore their differences in persistence and scope. This day will enhance your ability to manage client-side data efficiently.

## Day 21: Leetcode Easy Challenges
Explore fundamental Leetcode problems with solutions that involve common data structures and algorithms. Tackle tasks like finding two numbers that sum up to a target, reversing an integer, checking for palindromes, merging two sorted linked lists, and validating parentheses. Through these exercises, enhance your problem-solving skills and familiarity with coding interviews.

## Day 22: LeetCode Medium Challenges
In this set of challenges, we've tackled several classic problems: adding two numbers represented by linked lists, finding the longest substring without repeating characters, calculating the maximum area of water between vertical lines, identifying unique triplets that sum to zero, and grouping anagrams.
