# 30 Days JavaScript Challenge
This is a repository for the 30 Days JavaScript Challenge by Chai Aur Code

## Day 1: Variables and Data Types

Explore the basics of JavaScript variables and data types, including variable declaration using var, let, and const, as well as understanding different data types and their usage in practical examples.

## Day 2: Operators
Delve into the various operators in JavaScript, such as arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, and ternary operators. Perform tasks to understand their application and behavior in different scenarios.

## Day 3: Control Structures
Learn about control structures in JavaScript, including if-else statements, switch cases, and conditional (ternary) operators. Practice using these structures to control the flow of your code.

## Day 4: Loops
Master looping constructs in JavaScript with for, while, and do-while loops. Understand nested loops and loop control statements like break and continue through practical exercises and examples.

## Day 5: Functions
Understand different types of functions in JavaScript, including function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions. Learn about function parameters, default values, and higher-order functions through various activities and examples.

## Day 6: Arrays
Dive into array manipulation and iteration in JavaScript. Learn how to create and access arrays, use basic and intermediate array methods, and work with multi-dimensional arrays. Explore practical examples and exercises to reinforce your understanding of array operations.

## Day 7: Objects
Explore the fundamentals of objects in JavaScript. Learn how to create and access object properties, define and use object methods, work with nested objects, and leverage the this keyword. Understand object iteration techniques and practice with comprehensive exercises.

## Day 8: ES6+ Features
Dive into the advanced features introduced in ES6 and beyond. This includes learning about template literals for string interpolation, destructuring arrays and objects for concise code, using spread and rest operators for flexible function arguments and array manipulation, understanding default parameters for functions, and leveraging enhanced object literals. Each activity provides practical examples to solidify your understanding.


## Day 9: DOM Manipulation
Explore the power of JavaScript to dynamically interact with the Document Object Model (DOM). Learn how to select and manipulate elements, create and append new elements, remove elements, modify attributes and classes, and handle events. Each task demonstrates practical techniques for effective DOM manipulation, enhancing your ability to create interactive web pages.

## Day 10: Event Handling 
Master various event handling techniques in JavaScript, including basic events, mouse events, keyboard events, form events, and event delegation. Learn to manipulate the DOM through event listeners and handlers to create interactive web pages.
